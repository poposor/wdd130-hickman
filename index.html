            It can be difficult to focus when studying. What if there were a way to keep yourself accountable and work in small, obtainable steps?
            The Pomodoro study technique is a time management tool.
            How does it work?
            It’s a cycle of study time and breaks. For example, you might set a timer to study for 25 minutes and then have a five-minute break. After the break, you study for 25 more minutes before your next break. 
            How do I use it?
            You can set your own timer, or look at our resources page to find links to YouTube videos that have the timers on loop for you.
